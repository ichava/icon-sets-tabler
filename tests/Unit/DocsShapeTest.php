/**
 * Pins the docs shape the authoring standard specifies, by name.
 *
 * The estate already had a parity guard, and it could not have caught this:
 * `StubEstateParityTest` derives the required page set from whatever
 * `icon-sets-flag` happens to ship, so deleting a page from the pack and from
 * the stub together leaves it green. It pins agreement, not the decision.
 *
 * The five concern pages are named here deliberately. Settled 2026-09-22 on
 * measurement rather than taste: `laranail/authkit-ldap` is one source file and
 * 45 lines and ships all five, and across 67 laranail repositories the twenty
 * thinnest average 3.6 of 5. A thin package writes shorter pages, not fewer.
 *
 * This file is only a gate if something runs it on a markdown change.
 * `tests.yml` carries `paths-ignore: ['**.md']`, so it skips exactly the change
 * that would delete a page -- which is why `docs.yml` exists beside it.
