# Getting started

*How-to guide.* Your first icon from this pack, once [Installation](installation.md) is done.

## Render one

```blade
<x-ichava::icon name="ichava/icon-sets-tabler::<variant>/<name>" class="w-6 h-6" />
```

The component is core's and is generic: the pack is named in the path, not in the tag. Which
`variant` values this pack accepts is the subject of [Variants](variants.md).

## Or from PHP

```blade
{{ ichava('ichava/icon-sets-tabler::<variant>/<name>')->class('w-5 h-5') }}
```

Both spellings of the path resolve to the same icon -- slash and dot are normalised by one
resolver, documented in core's [icon path format](https://github.com/ichava/core/blob/main/docs/tools/icon-path-format.md).

## If nothing renders

Almost always the seed has not run. Check with:

```bash
php artisan ichava::ichava-core.info icons --package=ichava/icon-sets-tabler
```

Zero rows means [Installation](installation.md) step 4 is outstanding. Core's
[troubleshooting](https://github.com/ichava/core/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md) covers the rest.
